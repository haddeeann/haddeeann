# Haddee Ann is a Wizard ✨

## My Repos

- 🔭 I’m currently working on leetcode problems. I add them to the Tidbits repo. I also add a little bit every day to my website about NumPy. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NumPy.

- 👯 My past repos include:

### Yellow Umbrella Makers
I usually put up code when I want to do something specifically public with it. This repo is me making the intial site at https://yummyapps.io. 

It uses Gatsby, which is a JAM website maker. I thought that was a super interesting choice. I also wondered about making a website, like a blog, with only markdown and a React front end. That is what Gatsby does.

By the powers combined of Gatsby and Netlify I had a blog launched in no time. Well, a very small amount of time.

### Patricia.portfolio
This is a site that lives at https://hellonurse.io. I named the URL after the animaniacs characters. 

It's made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's a no-frills thing. And I launched the site with Netlify. 

I had initially launched with GitHub pages. And then I switched over because I started paying to host my own sites on Netlify.

### The Happy Cloud
This is a site that lives at https://the-happy-cloud.netlify.app/. I didn't buy a domain for it, so it's just the default that Netlify gives me. This project demonstrates how Green Sock the JS library and React can work together.

### Adventure Dog
This is a blog for dog care. I have a dog and he is super adorable. So I wanted to make a blog about dog care and training. I wrote the articles as well. It lives on Netlify as well. It's at https://adventure-dog.netlify.app/. It's made using React, Gatsby, and CSS modules.

### Robot Dreams
This site fetches data (poems) from a free API and displays one poem at a time. It lives at https://haddeeann.github.io/robot-dreams/.

It's made with HTML, JavaScript, CSS. And it is hosted on GitHub Pages. If you go to the site you can search for your favorite poet and it will return the first poem it find by that author.
